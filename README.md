# Special Recognition: 
I always do participate in various study groups while working on projects with collaborators including but not necessarily limited to the following peers:
A Reed
Andrew Clifft
Forest Prodan
Ilknur Sekmen
Josh Gibson
Justin Ibeh
Karson Kosek
Kiara Shannon
Luisa Dinwiddie
Margo Berry
Maria Wolfgang
Morgan Escue
Morgan Foge
Nathan Johnson
William Brewer
Although I did attend office hours and study groups and always find Andrew Clifft to be a wealth of knowledge, I collaborated extensively with Josh Gibson for this project, and I learned to use the AskBCS Learning Assistant extensively. I also spent a lot of time with Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12282232/how-do-i-count-occurrence-of-unique-values-inside-a-list) and TutorialsPoint (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-count-unique-values-inside-a-list-in-python) when working on the PyPoll challenge. TutorialsPoint taught me to use a dictionary, and my AskBCS Learning Assistant taught me that ChatGPT is good for brainstrorming but can only be trusted so far; however, between the three of them, I was able to avoid the heartache that Justin and company chose by following the same iterative process we used for both the PyBank challenge as well as last week's VBA challenge. Why haven't we learned more about these dictionaries? THAT's the way to go!
